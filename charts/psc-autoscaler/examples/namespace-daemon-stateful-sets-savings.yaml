      #  You should consider if you want to enable StatefulSets automation.
      #  You might want a human eye while restarting production databases, in general, pods with persistent volume are more fragile.
      #  As well, if your StatefulSet runs on dedicated nodes, reducing workload resources will not help to reduce the cost
